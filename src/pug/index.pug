								p John helped us sell two properties in 2015 back-to-back &amp; delivered exceptional results. First of all, John came highly recommended from a trusted family friend that had multiple transactions with John, so we knew about John"s great track record. John"s strengths are: 1) extensive market knowledge: we were impressed with John from the first time we met him, when he came prepared with a detailed market analysis for our properties &amp; answered all our questions, since we had a difficult situation of remote owners, overseas document signing, etc. John had all the answers! 2) diligence: since our family already moved away, we counted on John to help us get the properties into presentable condition. We literally just handed John the keys &amp; said good bye. John followed through and scheduled inspectors, house cleaners, junk haulers, etc, He freed us from the burden of managing the work remotely. 3) great strategist: John"s marketing &amp; pricing strategies helped us sell both properties quickly at our desired prices. We were surprised at how fast the first offer came in. In the case of a multiple-offer situation, John knew how to negotiate to our advantage. 4) teamwork + network: John has a great team of trusted service providers &amp; banking contacts that made our transactions go smoothly and easily. Overall, we were very pleased with the outcome &amp; very grateful for John"s expertise &amp; assistance. John will be our realtor for life in the LA/San Gabriel Valley area.

								p John helped us get our dream house in Lake Forest in 2015. We had seen so many houses in multiple cities before we settle down, and he had been very patient with us. It took awhile but he surely made house hunting a fun experience for me and my family. I am glad that all of us had learned a lot from these experience. Highly recommended!!

								p John helped us sell our mistake home and buy our dream home. First and foremost, it isn"t easy trying to sell and then buy at the same time, with a loan contingency in this "sellers market" however, he was able to orchestrate this. We had multiple unexpected change of plans throughout, but he was always able to accommodate. He is very informative and his quick response help you through the process with ease, leaving you with no doubts. Thumbs up!!

								p I want to thank John for his excellent service back in April 2012 when we bought our house in Yorba Linda. We couldn"t ask for more. We got an awesome deal with his help and his advice. Till this day we still thank him and will refer more friends and family to John.
