							h3 Price It Right
							p Activity in the first month of a listing is always the best, so don't risk wasting it. Price too high, and scare off many buyers and other agents. Don't get caught up in pricing games.

							h3 Be the "Neighborhood Expert"
							p Always know what's on the market, what sold recently, and the overall status of the neighborhood. Nowadays, anyone can look at houses online but the top agents know what lurks below the surface.

							h3 Hire a Real Estate Agent
							p Studies show that home sellers who use a real estate agent to represent them generally get a better price than those who sell the home themselves. Real estate agents are up-to-date on critical processes and can help keep you out of trouble. They can also help you get your home sold at the best price in the right time frame. Equally as important, real estate agents add objectivity to an inherently emotional transaction: the sale of your home.

								br
								| Touch up interior and exterior paint as needed.
								br
								| Install new carpeting and flooring if it appears worn or dated.
								br
								| Make sure the front is clean and spruced up â€“ curb appeal will create a favorable first impression.
